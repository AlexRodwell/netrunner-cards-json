Keiko's trigger condition is met when installing a companion is complete, at step 8.3.6 in the rules for installing a card. Keiko becomes active before that, at step 8.3.5, so the ability is able to see that its trigger condition is met, and the Runner can trigger it and gain a credit.\n\nIf the Runner spends a credit from Paladin Poemu to install Keiko, can they trigger Keiko's ability?\n>No. Since Paladin Poemu is a companion, the first time the Runner spends credits from or installs a companion this turn is paying Keiko's install cost, which happens at step 8.3.4. Keiko's abilities only become active at step 8.3.5, so the ability is not active when the trigger condition is met, and it cannot be triggered.",
