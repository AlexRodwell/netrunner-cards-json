    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner use Charlatan to bypass a piece of ice after the Corp rezzes it?",
    "answer": "No. “When approached” abilities meet their trigger condition at step 2 of a run when the approach begins, but the Corp does not rez approached ice until step 2.3 of the run. Charlatan’s ability creates a conditional ability that only meets its trigger condition the first time the runner approaches an already rezzed piece of ice.",
