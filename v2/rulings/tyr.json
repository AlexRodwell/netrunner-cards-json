If the Corp uses Tyr's Hand to prevent a subroutine from being broken after a click is spent, do they still get the extra allotted [click] next turn? What if the Runner breaks the last subroutine using Týr's ability and then immediately uses Hippo to trash it (so that Týr is not active for a conditional ability to resolve)?\n>In both cases, the Corp will still get the extra allotted [click]. Týr gives the Corp this benefit in response to the Runner spending [click]. It does not need a subroutine to actually be broken before it can apply.",
