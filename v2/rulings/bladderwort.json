    "question": "How do multiple rezzed copies of [Bladderwort](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33041) interact with each other?",
    "answer": "The Corp resolves 1 copy of the ability at a time in full before moving on to the next copy. If a chain reaction or other “when your turn begins” ability resolves in the middle of this process and causes the Corp to lose or spend credits, it is possible that a copy resolved later could do net damage even though the Corp had too many credits to meet the requirement on a previously-resolved copy.",
