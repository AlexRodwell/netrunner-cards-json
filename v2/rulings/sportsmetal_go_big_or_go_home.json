    "question": "####[UFAQ 24](https://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nWhat happens if the Runner steals an agenda in the middle of accessing cards from R&D and the Corp uses Sportsmetal to draw cards?",
    "answer": "The Runner continues accessing from the topmost card of R&D that the Runner has not already accessed. If Sportsmetal drew past the point the Runner already accessed, the new top of R&D is the next card accessed. If Sportsmetal drew 2 cards the Runner has already accessed and there are other cards the Runner has already accessed, the Runner simply continues accessing from the point in R&D at which they are already accessing.\n\nAudited by Null Signal Rules (2022.07).",
