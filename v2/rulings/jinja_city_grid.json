    "question": "####[UFAQ 20](https://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Down_the_White_Nile_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Corp plays [Anonymous Tip](/en/card/20118), do they draw all the cards at once and then decide which ice to install with Jinja City Grid, or do they draw the cards one at a time and decide as ice is drawn whether or not to install any of those ice?",
    "answer": "Drawing multiple cards at once is a batch effect. The Corp draws all three cards, then Jinja City Grid meets its trigger condition simultaneously for each drawn piece of ice. The Corp decides the order in which to trigger the instances of Jinja City Grid's ability, and thus the order in which to install the drawn ice.\n\nIf the Runner initiates a run on a server with Jinja City Grid and the Corp has a scored [Advanced Concept Hopper](/en/card/10011), will the Runner approach an ice drawn with Advanced Concept Hopper and installed with Jinja City Grid?",
