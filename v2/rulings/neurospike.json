Rather, it looks back at the history of the Corp’s turn for each time that they scored an agenda, then checks the printed point value of each of those scored agendas at the time when they were scored. Forfeiting an agenda has no effect on the amount of damage it adds to [Neurospike](/en/card/30049)’s total. ",
