    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nWhen resolving the trace on Waiver, by how much does the Corp’s trace strength need to exceed the Runner’s link strength in order to trash cards with cost X, such as [Angel Arena](/en/card/06080) and [Bribery](/en/card/06118)?",
    "answer": "The Corp’s trace strength only needs to exceed the Runner’s link strength by 1 to be considered successful and trash cards with cost X. A printed cost of X is considered to be 0 when referenced outside of paying that cost to play/install the card.",
