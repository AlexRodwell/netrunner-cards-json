    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the Runner accesses an Alliance card from HQ, is the Corp required to tell the Runner how much influence that card is worth in their deck? What about if the Runner accesses an Alliance card from R&D?",
    "answer": "No. It is assumed that the Corp's deck is legal, and the influence value on the card is irrelevant for the purposes of gameplay.\n\nWhat happens if the Corp no longer has enough cards in their deck to satisfy the Alliance requirement for a card due to cards being removed from the game?",
