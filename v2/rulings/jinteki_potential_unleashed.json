    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Runner suffers net damage and one of the cards trashed is [I've Had Worse](/en/card/07032), which goes first: trashing the top card of the stack or drawing three cards?",
    "answer": "Both Potential Unleashed and I’ve Had Worse meet their trigger conditions at the same time. If it is currently the Runner’s turn, they draw three cards then trash a card from the top of the stack. If it is the Corp’s turn, the top card of the stack is trashed then the Runner draws three cards.\n\nIf the Runner takes more than 1 net damage at once (e.g. with [Project Junebug](/en/card/01069)), how many cards do they trash from the top of the stack?",
