    "answer": "If the Runner chooses to use Rip Deal's ability, they still access cards from the root of HQ, but those cards do not add to the number of cards that the Runner adds from the heap to the grip.\n\nIf the Runner has an installed [Nerve Agent](/en/card/02041), does it gain an additional virus counter before or after the Runner decides to use Rip Deal's effect?",
