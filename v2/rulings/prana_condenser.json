Once the expected amount of damage is 0 or less, any further interrupt abilities preventing damage are not relevant and can no longer be triggered.\n\nIf the Corp plays Neural EMP and prevents the damage with Prāna Condenser, then they use Prāna Condenser's other ability to do net damage, can the Runner use No One Home?\n>No. Since the Corp is playing Neural EMP on their own turn, they can prevent its damage before the Runner has a chance to trigger No One Home, stopping it from being relevant at that time. Then, the damage from Prāna Condenser is the second time the Corp \"would do net damage\" that turn, so No One Home's trigger condition is not met.",
