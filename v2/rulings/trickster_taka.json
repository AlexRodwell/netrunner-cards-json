    "question": "####[Null Signal](https://nullsignal.games) [Downfall Release Notes](https://nullsignal.games/products/Downfall/DFReleaseNotes#QandAforDownfall) [Null Signal Rules Team]\nCan the Runner avoid the tag from Trickster Takaâ€™s last ability?",
    "answer": "Yes. Just like with avoiding the tag from Data Raven, the ability only requires the Runner to make a choice. Once the choice is made, whether or not the effect is prevented does not undo or invalidate the choice.",
