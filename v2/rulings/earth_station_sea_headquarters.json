The game trashes all cards in and protecting all other remote servers. This trashing cannot be prevented.\n\nWhat happens if the previous situation occurs while Architect is rezzed protecting a remote server?\n>Per its new errata, only players and their card abilities are prohibited from trashing a rezzed Architect. Since the game, not the Corp, trashes the cards in the servers the Corp doesn't keep, Architect's ability does not affect it. The Corp is not required to choose a server protected by Architect as the server they keep.",
