    "question": "####[UFAQ 24](https://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner trash [Mirﾄ）u](/en/card/12071) with Hippo? If they do, are they moved to Archives?",
    "answer": "Yes, Hippo can be used after breaking the subroutine on Mirﾄ）u, and the Runner will not be moved to Archives. Mirﾄ）u's ability checks whether the Runner broke its printed subroutine at the time they would pass it (Step 4 of the run). Since Hippo's ability triggers as soon as all subroutines are broken (in step 3.1), Mirﾄ）u is no longer active in order to replace passing with moving to Archives.",
