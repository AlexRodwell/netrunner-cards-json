    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the Runner uses Mongoose to break subroutines on a piece of ice, and then that ice is encountered a second time during the run (through [Cell Portal](/en/card/01074) or The [The Twins](/en/card/07024), for example) can the Runner still break its subroutines with Mongoose?",
    "answer": "Yes. It is the same copy of the ice, so the Runner can break subroutines on it.",
