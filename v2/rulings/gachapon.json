What happens if another effect moves or shuffles cards within the stack while Gachapon is resolving?\n>Cards that are set aside are in their own zone and are no longer in their previous location. See the notes on the set-aside zone, above. Other effects that manipulate the stack cannot affect the cards from Gachapon while they are set aside.\n\nHow do set-aside cards interact with Paige Piper?\n>Assuming no cards have been installed earlier in the turn, Paige Piper meets her trigger condition when Gachapon installs a card. The install is the end of an instruction, so the Runner can only use her ability in the reaction window immediately after that checkpoint, before the other set-aside cards are shuffled back into the stack or removed from the game. Paige's ability will not be able to trash the set-aside cards.\n\nAre cards set aside with Gachapon faceup or facedown?\n>Faceup. The set-aside zone is a public zone, so cards are set aside faceup unless otherwise indicated.\n\nWhat happens if the Runner uses Gachapon with fewer than 6 cards in their stack?\n>The Runner sets aside all of the cards in their stack, and may install one of those cards if appropriate as normal. If there are 4 or more cards left after this, the Runner chooses 3 of them and randomizes them to form their new stack. If 3 or fewer cards are set aside after the install, all of them are randomized to form the new stack.",
