Bypassing causes the encounter to end immediately, which is the trigger condition for Anansi's ability.\n\nCan the Runner use [Hunting Grounds](/en/card/09035) to prevent Anansi's ability?\n>No. Anansi has a \"when encounter ends\" ability, not a \"when encountered\" ability.\n\nIf Anansi is derezzed or uninstalled during an encounter, does it still do 3 net damage?\n>No. Anansi is no longer active in either case, so its ability cannot trigger.",
