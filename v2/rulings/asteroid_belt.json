To determine what a cost is when effects are modifying its value, start with the default value for that cost ([Asteroid Belt](07012)’s printed rez cost is 9[c]), apply each effect that increases the cost ([Tread Lightly](30012) adds 3[c]), and then apply each effect that lowers the cost ([Asteroid Belt](07012)’s ability subtracts 3[c] for each hosted advancement counter).\n\n>9[c] + 3[c] – (3[c] ✕ 4) = 12[c] – 12[c] = 0[c].\n",
