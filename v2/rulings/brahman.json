    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the Runner uses both Brahman and [Faerie](/en/card/02104) to break subroutines on a piece of ice, can the Runner choose to add Faerie to the top of their stack instead of trashing Faerie?",
    "answer": "Yes. Faerie and Brahman meet their trigger condition simultaneously, so the Runner chooses the order in which their conditional abilities resolve. If the Runner chooses to resolve Brahmanâ€™s ability first, then Faerie is no longer active, so its conditional ability fails to resolve.",
