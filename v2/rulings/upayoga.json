    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the Runner only has 1<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> after losing the Psi game on Upayoga, do they lose that credit?",
    "answer": "Yes. Upayoga’s subroutine lacks an “if able” clause, so as much of the effect as can be resolved must resolve.\n\nIf the Runner has no credits in their credit pool after losing the Psi game on Upayoga, can they be forced to lose credits on other cards, such as [Ghost Runner](/en/card/06040) or [Net Celebrity](/en/card/06038)?",
