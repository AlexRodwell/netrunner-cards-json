    "answer": "No, the static ability on [Magnet](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31044) is already active before the conditional ability on [Parasite](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01012) can meet its trigger condition.",

    "question": "Can the Runner host a Ca誰ssa program on a [Magnet](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31044) that is already hosting another Ca誰ssa program?",
    "answer": "No. Subtypes are not abilities and are not lost because of [Magnet](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31044). All the Ca誰ssa programs require themselves to move to ice not already hosting Ca誰ssa, so the Runner cannot move them to [Magnet](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31044) if one is already hosted.\n",
