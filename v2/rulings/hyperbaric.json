    "question": "Can the Runner use [Rigging Up](/en/card/33024) to put an extra counter on [Hyperbaric](/en/card/33026)?",
    "answer": "Yes. [Hyperbaric](/en/card/33026)’s “when you install” ability resolves in between the instruction from [Rigging Up](/en/card/33024) that installs it and the instruction that gives the option to charge it. By the time the latter instruction resolves, [Hyperbaric](/en/card/33026) has a hosted power counter and is legal to charge.",
