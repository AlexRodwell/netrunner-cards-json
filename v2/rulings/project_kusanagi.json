    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Corp choose an unrezzed piece of ice for Project Kusanagi's ability?",
    "answer": "Yes, but it won’t do anything because unrezzed ice cannot have subroutines. Note that the Corp can only activate Project Kusagani’s ability if there is a rezzed piece of ice somewhere: to activate the ability, it must have the potential to change the game state, but once the ability resolves the Corp is not required to make a choice that actually changes the game state.",
