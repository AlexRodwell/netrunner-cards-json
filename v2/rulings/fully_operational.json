The ability resolves once, then it is repeated for the one matching remote server.\n\nHow many times does NASX trigger while resolving Fully Operational?\n\n>All of the times. All of them. (It triggers for each iteration in which the Corp chooses to gain credits).\n\nCan the Corp increase the number of repetitions for Fully Operational while it is resolving (e.g. by drawing a piece of ice and installing it with Jinja City Grid)?\n\n>Only if this happens during the initial resolution. When the instruction to “Repeat this process” would resolve, it then counts your servers, and that number of repetitions is locked in.",
