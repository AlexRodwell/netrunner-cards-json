    "answer": "No. Daruma swaps out a card installed in the same server from which it was trashed. There are no cards installed in central servers, only the inactive cards in the Corpâ€™s hand/deck/discard and the cards installed in the root.\n\nWhat about using Daruma in a remote server to swap something into the root of a central server?",
