    "question": "####[Null Signal](https://nullsignal.games) [Null Signal Rules Team Update]\nThe Runner has [Citadel Sanctuary](/en/card/11070), Thunder Art Gallery, and [Autoscripter](/en/card/06076) installed. At the end of the Runnerâ€™s turn, they use Citadel Sanctuary to remove a tag, triggering Thunder Art Gallery. Does the Runner gain a click from Autoscripter if they install a program with the Gallery?",
    "answer": "Yes. But, players cannot spend clicks outside of the Action Phase and any of the Runner's unspent clicks are lost during the discard phase (5.7.2c).\n\nThe Runner has [Forger](/en/card/08065) and Thunder Art Gallery installed when they access a [Snare!](/en/card/20098). If they avoid the tag with Forger and install a [Sports Hopper](/en/card/10064) with the Gallery, can they use the Sports Hopper to draw more cards to survive the incoming net damage? Can the Runner install and use [Bio-Modeled Network](/en/card/12006) to prevent the incoming net damage?",
