    "question": "Does [Femme Fatale](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31022) need to match strength to use its bypass ability?",
    "answer": "No, the bypass ability does not have an interface flag, so there is no prerequisite of matching the strength of the encountered ice in order to use that ability.",

    "answer": "Yes. Since the bypass ability is an optional ability, you are considered to be using the ability. The credits from [Cyberfeeder](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25008) can be spent to pay for the use of that ability.\n",

    "answer": "No, the choice of ice is only retained for as long as [Femme Fatale](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31022) is installed. When it is uninstalled, the choice is forgotten. When you reinstall [Femme Fatale](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31022), it can only bypass the ice chosen during its most recent installation.\n",

    "question": "When an ice chosen for [Femme Fatale](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31022)'s ability is uninstalled, can it be bypassed with [Femme Fatale](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31022)'s ability after it has been reinstalled later in the game?",
    "answer": "No. The newly installed ice is a different game object than the originally installed ice. The chosen ice in [Femme Fatale](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31022)’s ability only applies to the original object, which doesn’t exist anymore.\n",
