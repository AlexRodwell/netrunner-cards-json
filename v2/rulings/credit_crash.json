    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nDuring a run initiated by Credit Crash, is the Runner required to reveal the accessed card to the Corp if it is accessed from R&D?",
    "answer": "The card must be revealed. This effect requires the Corp to act on an element of the card, so it is satisfied by the Corp examining that card.\n\nIf the Corp prevents the trashing of the first card accessed with Credit Crash, can the Runner still trash that card normally?",
