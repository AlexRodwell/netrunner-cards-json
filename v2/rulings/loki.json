    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf Loki gains a subroutine with a self-reference from another piece of ice, such as a trap like [Kitsune](/en/card/06043), what happens?",
    "answer": "Everything in the subroutine resolves as normal, except for any effect with a self-reference in it. The reference does not refer to Loki, so it cannot resolve.\n\nIf Loki gains a subroutine from a [Mausolus](/en/card/11097) with 3 advancement tokens on it, does the regular text resolve or does the parenthetical text resolve?",
