It cannot be rezzed during paid ability windows that don’t allow rezzing non-ice cards, most notably the paid ability window during an encounter.\n\nCan the Corp rez Rime with the ability on Architects of Tomorrow?\n\n>No. Rime is not a bioroid.\n\nCan the Corp rez Rime when they could rez Tyr’s Hand or Zaibatsu Loyalty?\n\n>No. Rime can be rezzed during paid abilities where ice cannot normally be rezzed. It does not apply to special rez abilities from other cards.",
