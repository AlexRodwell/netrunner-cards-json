See section 9.1.6 in CR 1.4.\n\nOK, that was a confusing answer. Can we talk about the kinds of \"using\" one at a time?\n>Absolutely! And for simplicity, feel free to assume that we're always talking about the first relevant thing that happens during a run that turn.\n\nIf the Runner triggers a paid ability on a piece of hardware, do they put a power counter on The Back?\n>Yes. Paid abilities are always optional.\n\nIf the Runner triggers the paid ability from Dedicated Processor to increase its host's strength, do they put a power counter on The Back?\n>No. The ability is granted to the host icebreaker, so its source is that icebreaker. The Runner is \"using\" the icebreaker, not Dedicated Processor.\n\nDoes Masterwork (v37)â€™s first ability cause the Runner to put a power counter on The Back?\n>No. The card draw ability on Masterwork (v37) is entirely mandatory, so the Runner is not making any choices and is not \"using\" the ability.\n\nDoes Masterwork (v37)'s second ability cause the Runner to put a power counter on The Back?\n>Yes. If the Runner chooses to install a card with the ability, they are \"using\" it and meet The Back's trigger condition. If they choose not to install a card, however, they are not \"using\" Masterwork (v37).\n\nIf the Runner spends a credit from Cyberfeeder, do they put a power counter on The Back?\n>Yes. The Runner is spending the credit due to Cyberfeeder's own ability.\n\nIf the Runner spends a virus counter from Friday Chip to break a subroutine with Yusuf, do they put a power counter on The Back?\n>No. Even though the counter was hosted on hardware when it was spent, the ability allowing it to be spent came from Yusuf, so the Runner is only \"using\" Yusuf.\n\nIf the Runner installs a program on NetChip because of its first ability, do they put a power counter on The Back?\n>No. NetChip's hosting permission is a static ability, so it is active continuously and is never triggered or resolved. The only static abilities that can meet the definition of \"using\" a card are those that allow counters to be spent.",
