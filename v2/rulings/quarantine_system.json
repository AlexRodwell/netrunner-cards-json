    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nThe Corp, playing [Jemison Astronautics](/en/card/12016), uses Quarantine System to forfeit a [Hostile Takeover](/en/card/01094). What is the exact order of operations, and how much discount does the Corp receive for rezzing an [Asteroid Belt](/en/card/07012)?",
    "answer": "The trigger for Jemison Astronautics is the forfeiting of the agenda. As this is a chain reaction, Jemison must resolve before Quarantine System, so the Corp places 2 advancement tokens on a card, which can be placed on Asteroid Belt. Then, Quarantine System resolves and rezzes one piece of ice at a time. If the Asteroid Belt receives the advancement tokens from Jemison, then the total rez cost of the Asteroid Belt is 1: 9 printed rez cost, 6 discounted for having 2 advancement tokens, and 2 discounted for the printed agenda point on the forfeited Hostile Takeover.\n\nIf the Corp forfeits a card that becomes an agenda for Quarantine System, such as [\"Clones are not People\"](/en/card/10052), how much is the discount for rezzing the ice?",
