Since the card moves between zones between the two times the Runner steals it, the game does not consider it to be the same agenda, and Punitive deals damage for both times it was stolen, for a total of 6 damage.\n\nIf Media Blitz is copying Divested Trust, can the corp use it?\n\n>No. Media Blitz is neither an agenda nor in the score area, so it cannot be forfeited.\n\nWhat if there are multiple agendas in Archives while the Corp has Divested Trust scored?\n\n>The Runner accesses cards in Archives one at a time in the order of their choice. After an access is complete, they then choose the next card to access. They do not have to choose an order for all of the cards up front. The Corp will have to decide whether or not to use Divested Trust each time the Runner chooses to access an agenda, without knowing the order that any other cards in Archives will be accessed.",
