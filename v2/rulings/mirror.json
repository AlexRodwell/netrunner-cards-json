    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the number of recurring credits available on [Pheromones](/en/card/02086) has decreased (e.g. from the Corp using [Cyberdex Virus Suite](/en/card/07027) during the run on R&D), can the Runner still use Mirror to replace a recurring credit if the number of credits still hosted on Pheromones is greater than or equal the number of virus counters?",
    "answer": "No. Recurring credits can only be replaced up to the value shown on the card, never over it.\n\nCan the Runner use Mirror's ability to replace a spent recurring credit on [Whizzard: Master Gamer](/en/card/02001)?",
