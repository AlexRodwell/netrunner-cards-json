What if the Runner cannot draw cards due to some other effect?\n>The Corp can choose either option regardless of the Runner’s stack or abilities affecting the Runner’s ability to draw cards. Making the choice for [Wildcat Strike](/en/card/30002) is not taking an action or using an ability, so it does not need to have the potential to change the game state.",
