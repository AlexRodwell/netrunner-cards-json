    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nIf the Runner has both Bazaar and [Replicator](/en/card/02088) installed, can they install all copies of a piece of hardware from Grip and Stack by installing the first copy?",
    "answer": "Yes. Bazaar and Replicator meet their trigger condition simultaneously, so the Runner can choose to trigger Replicator first and then trigger Bazaar. The Runner may choose to repeat this process until there are no more copies of that hardware available to install.",
