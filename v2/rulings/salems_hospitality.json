    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nCan the Corp play Salem's Hospitality while the Runner has an empty grip?",
    "answer": "No. Salem's Hospitality has no potential to change the game state, so the Corp cannot choose to take that action.\n\nIf the Runner accesses an Alliance card from HQ, is the Corp required to tell the Runner how much influence that card is worth in their deck? What about if the Runner accesses an Alliance card from R&D?",
