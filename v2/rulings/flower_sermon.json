They put one of those 3 cards on the bottom of R&D and draw the other 2. Finally, they put a card from HQ (which could be one of the drawn cards or another card) on top of R&D.\n\nWhat happens if the Corp uses Jinja City Grid to reveal and install all the cards they would draw while resolving Flower Sermon's ability?\n>The Corp must still put another card from HQ on top of R&D.",
