    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nDoes the counter spent to install a program with Chatterjee University count toward reducing the program's cost?",
    "answer": "Yes. The text of the ability resolves in order, so the counter is only removed after the program is installed. Therefore the counter is still on Chatterjee University when the install cost must be paid, and reduces the cost.\n\nCan the Runner use Chatterjee University's ability to install a program when there are no counters on it?",
