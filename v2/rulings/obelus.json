    "answer": "Two cards. The Runner is considered to have accessed two cards even if they end up being the same card.\n\nIf the Runner accesses cards from another server during a run on HQ or R&D, such as through the ability on [Hades Shard](/en/card/06059), does the Runner draw cards for those accesses as well?",
