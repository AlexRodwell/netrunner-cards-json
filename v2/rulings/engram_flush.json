If a subroutine on Engram Flush resolves outside of an encounter with it, or during an encounter in which no card type was chosen (perhaps due to Hunting Grounds's first ability), the Corp only reveals the grip and cannot trash anything.\n\nIf the Corp is playing Harishchandra Ent. and the Runner is tagged, can the Corp reveal the grip and trash a card with Engram Flush?\n>Yes. To reveal a card is to show it to all players and return it to its previous state. In this case, the previous state is another reveal effect in progress. Nothing prevents cards that are already visible from being revealed. Contrast this with \"expose\", which is distinct from \"reveal\" in that only installed, unrezzed cards can be exposed.",
