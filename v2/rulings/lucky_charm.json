    "question": "####[Null Signal](https://nullsignal.games) [Downfall Release Notes](https://nullsignal.games/products/Downfall/DFReleaseNotes#QandAforDownfall) [Null Signal Rules Team]\nCan the Runner use Lucky Charm to prevent the “when encountered” ability on Data Raven from ending the run without having to take a tag?",
    "answer": "Yes. Just like with avoiding the tag from Data Raven, the ability only requires the Runner to make a choice. Once the choice is made, whether or not the effect is prevented does not undo or invalidate the choice.\n\nCan the Runner use Lucky Charm to prevent the first subroutine on Fairchild from ending the run if they decline to pay the credits?",
