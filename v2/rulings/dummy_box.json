    "answer": "No. The program hosted on NetChip is trashed by the hosting rules and not by the Corp. Trashing hosted cards when the host is uninstalled cannot be prevented.\n\nIf the first subroutine on [Conundrum](/en/card/12120) resolves, can the Runner use Dummy Box to save the chosen program?",
