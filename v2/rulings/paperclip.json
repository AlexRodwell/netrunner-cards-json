    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner spend credits on [Cloak](/en/card/03041) to install Paperclip from the heap?",
    "answer": "No. While triggering Paperclip’s ability from the heap is considered using Paperclip, paying the install cost is part of the install action and not a cost of using the ability.\n\nCan the Runner use Paperclip’s paid ability even if its strength doesn’t match a piece of ice?\n>Yes, you can always trigger the ability to get the strength boost. However, if the strength of Paperclip does not match the ice’s strength after this part of the ability resolves, the “break subroutines” part will not do anything.\n\nCan the Runner trash Paperclip for [Null: Whistleblower](/en/card/11002) ability and then install Paperclip at the same encounter step?",
