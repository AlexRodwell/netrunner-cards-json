Has anything changed about how Cerebral Overwriter works?\n>Only in the most technical sense. The newly updated wording and the rules for nested costs in CR 1.4 indicate that the 3[c] in Cerebral Overwriter's second ability is a cost, which was not clear before. But the ability functions essentially as it always did.",
