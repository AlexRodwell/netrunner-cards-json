    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Runner uses [Joshua B.](/en/card/02042) to gain an extra click while untagged, can [Citadel Sanctuary](/en/card/11070) remove the tag gained from Joshua B.’s ability at the end of the turn?",
    "answer": "No. The Runner must be tagged when the end of the turn occurs in order for Citadel Sanctuary to meet its trigger condition. If the Runner takes a tag after the end of the turn has already occurred, such as through Joshua B.’s ability, then Citadel Sanctuary cannot retroactively meet its trigger condition.",
