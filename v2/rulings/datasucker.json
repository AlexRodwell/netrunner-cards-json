Because [Datasucker](/en/card/01008) says that the ice you are encountering must be rezzed, there are some rare encounters where it cannot be used, such as an encounter with an [Archangel](/en/card/09013) being accessed from the Corpâ€™s hand or deck. [Leech](/en/card/30008) can be used even during these encounters.",
