Has anything changed about how Self-modifying Code works?\n>No. We cleaned up this card's wording by removing the redundant directions to pay the install cost and to shuffle after the search, but those are still required parts of the ability. We felt that players would enjoy having a version of this iconic card with clean and concise text, so we opted not to include the frequently-used \"(Shuffle your stack after searching it)\" reminder text in this case.",
