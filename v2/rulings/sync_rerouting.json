SYNC Rerouting does not create a cost to initiate the run, so its effects can be prevented or avoided normally. Furthermore, when an ability directs that a player \"must\" resolve one of two effects, they are required to choose an effect they could potentially resolve, but this potential does not take into account interrupts that could apply after the choice is made.",
