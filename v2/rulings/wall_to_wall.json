Do they have to resolve them in the order they appear on the card?\n>No and no. The Corp chooses the next instruction to resolve after the previous one is finished resolving. They do not have to choose instructions that are written after those they have already chosen.\n\nCan the Corp resolve the same instruction on Wall to Wall more than once on the same turn?\n>No. Once one of the instructions has resolved, it cannot be chosen again during this instance of resolving the ability.\n\nIf the Corp adds Wall to Wall to HQ with choices remaining, can they continue to resolve its other instructions?\n>Yes. Wall to Wall's entire ability is already resolving, so it is independent of its source card and no longer requires that card to remain active.",
