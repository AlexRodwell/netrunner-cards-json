    "answer": "No. Since “unless” designates that trashing the top card of R&D is a nested cost (rule 1.15.10b), the Corp must trash a card to stop the Runner from drawing. If they do not trash a card, the Runner draws.\n\nIf the Runner’s stack is empty, does The Nihilist force the Corp to trash the top card of R&D?",
