District 99's trigger condition looks for cards trashed from any location.\n\nCan the Runner play Isolation by spending credits from Mystic Maemi to pay the play cost and trashing Mystic Maemi to pay the additional cost?\n>Yes. The play cost and additional cost are paid simultaneously, so Mystic Maemi's ability allowing the Runner to spend the credits is still active as the Runner is deciding how to pay the costs. Any credits left after the costs are paid are returned to the bank.",

[Mystic Maemi](/en/card/26072) was not installed until after the agenda was stolen, so the Runner cannot trigger its ability at that time.",
