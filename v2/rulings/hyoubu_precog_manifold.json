Once the run is declared successful, it can't stop being successful. The Runner just won't access cards if the run ends before they have the chance.\n\nIf the Runner makes a run using Sneakdoor Beta while Hyoubu Precog Manifold is active, and the chosen server is HQ, can Hyoubu Precog Manifold's ability resolve?\n>Yes. Under the errata from CR 1.4, Sneakdoor Beta changes the attacked server to HQ just before the run is declared successful, so the trigger condition of Hyoubu Precog Manifold's last ability is met.",
