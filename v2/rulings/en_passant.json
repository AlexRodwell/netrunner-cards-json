    "question": "Can the Runner play [En Passant](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31003) to trash a piece of ice that was passed while rezzed and then subsequently derezzed, such as by playing [Emergency Shutdown](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31016)?",
    "answer": "Yes. [En Passant](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31003) only cares about the current rezzed or unrezzed status of its target and whether it was passed during the Runnerâ€™s last run, not whether it happened to be rezzed at any point during that run.",
