    "question": "####[Null Signal](https://nullsignal.games) [Downfall Release Notes](https://nullsignal.games/products/Downfall/DFReleaseNotes#QandAforDownfall) [Null Signal Rules Team]\nWhat are the applicable uses for credits on Fencer Fueno other than trashing accessed cards? Can the Runner use the credits to break the subroutine when accessing Archangel?",
    "answer": "Once a run becomes successful, the credits on Fencer Fueno become available for the Runner to spend for any purpose until that run ends. The Runner can feel free to spend the credits on anything as if they were in their credit pool, including but not limited to the trace from Ash 2X3ZB9CY, the psi game from The Future Perfect, or even using a Self-Modifying Code during an access encounter with Archangel.",
