    "question": "####[UFAQ 24](https://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_and_Reverie_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Corp rez and move more than one Formicary per run?",
    "answer": "Yes. Although forcing the Runner into a Formicary negates the trigger for any additional Formicaries, the next thing the Runner does after passing the first Formicary is approach the server a second time. At that point the Corp could use a second Formicary, and even a third afterward in similar fashion.\n\nHow does Formicary interact with [Mti Mwekundu](/en/card/21114)?",
