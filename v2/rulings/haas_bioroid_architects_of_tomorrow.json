    "question": "Does [Haas-Bioroid: Architects of Tomorrow](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11072) meet its trigger condition if the Runner trashes an encountered bioroid?",
    "answer": "No. [Haas-Bioroid: Architects of Tomorrow](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11072) requires the Runner to pass a rezzed piece of ice in order to meet its trigger condition, and the trashed ice is neither rezzed nor unrezzed. Consequently, the ability is still available to meet its trigger condition later in the same turn.",
