    "answer": "No. Worlds Plaza uses the phrase “if able”, which applies to the entire effect of installing and rezzing a card. Since Zealous Judge cannot be rezzed in this circumstance, Worlds Plaza’s ability cannot be used to install it.\n\nThe Corp scores [License Acquisition](/en/card/06085) and the Runner is not tagged. Can the Corp install Zealous Judge with Licence Acquisition’s ability?",
