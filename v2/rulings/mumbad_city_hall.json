    "question": "####UFAQ [Damon Stone]\nCan the Corp use Mumbad City Hall when there is only one card in R&D? Does it matter if that card is an alliance card?\n>Yes, whether the last card is an alliance card or not. Since R&D is a hidden zone, the game doesn’t check whether the last card in R&D might meet the criteria for the search when determining if Mumbad City Hall’s ability has the potential to change the game state.\n\nCan the Corp use Mumbad City Hall when R&D is empty?",
    "answer": "No. Searching and shuffling an empty deck does not have the potential to change the game state.\n\nCan the Corp use Mumbad City Hall to search for an alliance card they can’t afford to play or install, just to shuffle R&D?\n>Mumbad City Hall can resolve at least partially any time there are cards in R&D, so it can be activated regardless of the outcome its effect will have. However, a player can only fail to find on a search if there are no cards matching the search criteria. If there are any alliance cards in R&D that can be played or installed, the Corp must find one of them, reveal it, and play or install it. If there are only alliance cards that cannot be played or installed, the Corp must reveal one of them before shuffling it back into R&D. If there are no alliance cards in R&D, then no cards are revealed, and the effect just shuffles R&D.\n\nIf [Near-Earth Hub: Broadcast Center](/en/card/06005) uses Mumbad City Hall to install [Mumba Temple](/en/card/10018) in a new remote server, do they draw a card before or after shuffling R&D?",
