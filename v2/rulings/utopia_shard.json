    "question": "If the Runner returns [Utopia Shard](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06100) to their grip with [Steve Cambridge](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/13001), can they then install [Utopia Shard](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06100)?",
    "answer": "No. In order for [Utopia Shard](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06100) to install itself with its ability, it must already be in the Runnerâ€™s grip at the time the ability would meet its trigger condition.",
