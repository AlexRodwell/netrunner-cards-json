All that matters for Makler's trigger condition is that all subroutines were broken using only Makler and no other cards.\n\nWhat happens if the encountered ice gains additional subroutines after the Runner uses Makler to break all of the other subroutines?\n>Nothing special happens. Makler's ability has already triggered and resolved, so the Runner will not gain credits again, and adding new subroutines cannot force the Runner to return the credits gained.",
