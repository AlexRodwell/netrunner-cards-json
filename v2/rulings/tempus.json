    "question": "####[UFAQ 22](https://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/The_Devil_and_the_Dragon_UFAQ) [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Runner has only 1 <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> left when the trace from Tempus is successful, can they choose to lose <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> instead of taking the brain damage? What if the Runner has no <span class=\"icon icon-click\"></span> remaining?",
    "answer": "The Runner must choose an option that can be fully resolved if there is an option that can be fully resolved. Suffering 1 brain damage is always possible, so if the Runner has fewer than 2 clicks remaining, they must choose to suffer the brain damage. Note that once the choice is made, prevent/avoid abilities can still be used to modify the results of that choice.",
