    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nCan the Runner use Aaron Marrón when they have no tags? How about if the stack is empty?",
    "answer": "As long as either a tag would be removed or a card would be drawn, the ability has the potential to change the game state and thus can be used. If both the stack is empty and the Runner has no tags, then Aaron Marrón cannot possibly change the game state and thus cannot be used.",
