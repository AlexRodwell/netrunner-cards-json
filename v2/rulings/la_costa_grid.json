It cannot even be installed into the root of a central server.\n\nCan La Costa Grid be swapped to a central server?\n>No. The roots of central servers are not valid locations for a card with \"Remote server only.\" Cards can only be swapped if each card can legally exist in the other's location.\n\nWhat happens if somehow La Costa Grid ends up in the root of a central server anyway?\n>It is trashed during step 10.3.1e of the next checkpoint.\n\nCan La Costa Grid place advancement tokens on ice protecting its server?\n>No. La Costa Gridâ€˜s ability must target a card in the server itself.",
