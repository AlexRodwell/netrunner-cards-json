Per rule 10.1.1a, the Corp can always use an effect that purges virus counters, even if that effect would not normally be determined to have the potential to change the game state.\n\nWhen the Corp scores Cyberdex Sandbox, does its second ability allow them to trigger its first ability and gain 4[c]?\n>Yes. The first ability is active as soon as Cyberdex Sandbox enters the score area, well before the second ability resolves.",
