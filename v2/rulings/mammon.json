    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nIf the Runner uses [Dr. Lovegood](/en/card/09042) to blank the text of Mammon for the remainder of the turn, does Mammon still lose all of its power counters?",
    "answer": "No. When the Runner’s turn begins, they can trigger Mammon’s ability first to put power counters on it, then trigger Dr. Lovegood’s ability to blank Mammon’s text box. It is still the Runner’s turn when “turn ends” abilities meet their trigger condition, so Mammon’s text box will still be blank, and the ability that removes the counters won’t meet its trigger condition.",
