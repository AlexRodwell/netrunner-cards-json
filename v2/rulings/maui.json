    "question": "####UFAQ [Michael Boggs]\nDoes the Runner place credits on Māui when they install it if there are pieces of ice currently protecting HQ?",
    "answer": "Yes. The value of X is already greater than 0 when Māui is installed, so credits up to that X value are immediately placed on it.\n\nIf the Corp installs another piece of ice protecting HQ during a run on HQ, does Māui gain an additional credit for use immediately?",
